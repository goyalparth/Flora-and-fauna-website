                    Australia boasts a huge range of unique and diverse animal species.
                    Nearly half of its birds, 69% of mammals are found only in Australia. Along with that, over 90% species
                    of amphibians and reptiles are endemic to Australia and can not be found anywhere else in the world.

                    It is the only country in the world to have platypus, kangaroos, koalas, wombats and

                            Australia is home to around 800 species of mammals and almost half of them are marsupials.
                            Marsupials are born in a very early stage and are protected inside of a pouch. Australia is the
                            only
                            continent to have marsupials, monotremes (egg-laying mammals) and placental mammals (gain
                            nourishment by a placenta before birth).

                                    Koalas are marsupials. This means they carry
                                    their young ones in a pouch. Koalas live in
                                    eucalypt forests and can be found down the east coast of Australia. Some are also found
                                    in
                                    South Australia. They are lazy, sleeping for upto 20 hours everyday and eat only

                                    leaves. Sadly they are now considered vulnerable due to their decreasing populations.

                                    Cassowary is the Australia's heaviest flightless bird weighing upto 76kg. It has black
                                    plumage and its neck it bright blue and purple. It also has a large horn on their neck
                                    known
                                    as casque. They play an important role in maintaining the environment by spreading seeds
                                    in
                                    great distances. They were once found through much of northern Queesland but now are
                                    found
                                    only in Wet Tropics and Cape York. This species is listed as endangered.

                                    200 million years ago. They are apex predators capable of killing any animal that

                                    territory, including humans. Freshwater wetlands and floodplains are the most suitable

                                    Cane toad is the largest toad in the world. It is a native species in South and Central

                                    and was introduced in Australia in 1935 to deal with pest attacks on sugar cane. Since

                                    they have spread all the way from Queensland to Western Australia. They have serious

                                    the ecosystem of the country. They have poisnous glands and are highly toxic to other

                                    are responisble for the declining populations of native species and also compete with
