                    Flora of Australia has over 20,000 vascular and 14,000 non-vascular plants, 250,000 species of fungi and
                    3,000 lichens. About 86% of these species are endemic to Australia and can not be found anywhere else in
                    the world.

                            and fungi that stretch over several metres. This group includes algae, bryophytes, fungi and

                                    Bryophytes are non-vascular plants. This means they do not have an internal system for

                                    and provide food and shelter to marine animals. There are about 10,000 species of algae
                                    in
                                    Australia but very little of them is known and documented.

                                    Fungi are a diverse group of organisms that can not make their own food using
                                    photosynthesis and
                                    rely on their surroundings. They play an important role by recycling nutrients in the
                                    environment as they feed on dead plants and animals. There is an estimation of 250,000
                                    species
                                    of fungi in Australia and only 5% of them are studied and described.

                                    Lichen is a symbiosis between two different organisms- fungi and algae. Lichens can grow
                                    in any
                                    habitat ranging from ice cold regions to hod arid deserts due to their symbiotic
                                    relation. In
                                    lichens, fungi receive carbohydrates as a result of photosynthesis from algae and algae
                                    benefit
                                    by receiving water and nutrients from fungi. Lichens help us by absorbing the pollutants
                                    in the
                                    environment and help scientists extract and examine the level of these toxins in the
                                    environment. There are over 3000 species of lichens known in Australia, 34% of which are
                                    endemic.
