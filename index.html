                            refers to all the wild animals, plants and other living organisms.

                            Australia has been geographically isolated from rest of the world for a long time.
                            Due to which most of its flora and fauna is endemic which means, it can not
                            be found anywhere else in the world. It is also due to a number of habitats in Australia,
                            including
                            deserts, mountains, rainforests, bushlands, and reefs, its wildlife is unique to Australia.<br>
                            Australia is a very diverse country and home to a large amount of plants and animal species.
                            There
                            are thousands of different native species that can be found here. These include some of the most
                            unusual creatures of Earth.

                            The Supercontinent Gondwana, which comprised of today's Africa, South America, India, Antarctica
                            and
                            Australia, began to split apart 140 million years ago. Around 50 million years ago, Australia
                            separated
                            from it and started drifting northwards away from Antarctica. Because of the drift, Australia
                            was
                            isolated from
                            the rest of the world for a long time. Its climate got warmer and arid conditions developed.
                            This
                            lead to the evolution of various species of flora and fauna and became endemic to Australia.
